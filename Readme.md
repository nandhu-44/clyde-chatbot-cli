**If you dont have an apikey get it from [here](https://brainshop.ai/)**


Put it in the `.env` file like
```.env
url=YOUR_URL
```
or in the `env.txt` file like
```txt
YOUR_URL
```
A sample url would look like this 
```
http://api.brainshop.ai/get?bid={brainid}&key={apikey}&uid={uid}&msg=
```
You will get the values of brainid , apikey and uid from the above website.

Replace it with the sample url. (Dont use the curly braces).

The url they provide will end with a `=[msg]` . So make sure to remove it as we are appending it from user input.
